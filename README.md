## What I Learned from Building This Portfolio Website
Creating this portfolio website has been a great learning experience. Here are the key concepts and skills I gained:

## OnClick Effects
•	Implemented interactive elements using JavaScript's addEventListener.
•	Used it to trigger animations and smooth transitions.
•	Improved user experience by adding animation on button clicks and navigation interactions.

## Portfolio Effects
•	Designed interactive portfolio cards that showcase projects in an engaging way.
•	Used CSS animations and JavaScript to create hover effects, modals, and filtering options.
•	Learned how to make portfolio items more visually appealing while maintaining responsiveness.

## Sending Data to Google Sheets
•	Integrated a form submission feature that sends user input directly to Google Sheets.
•	Utilized an external script from another repository to handle data transfer securely.
•	Learned about Google Apps Script and how it enables backend-like functionality without a server.

This project helped me improve my front-end development skills and explore integrations with external services.
